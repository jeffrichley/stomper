> Created: 2024-09-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement AI agent integration with cursor-cli headless mode to enable automated code quality fixing. This feature will transform Stomper from a quality tool runner into an intelligent automated fixing system that can resolve linting errors, type errors, and test failures using AI agents while maintaining code integrity.

## User Stories

### Automated Code Quality Fixing

As a Python developer, I want Stomper to automatically fix code quality issues using AI agents, so that I can eliminate the tedious manual process of fixing linting errors, type errors, and test failures while maintaining confidence that the fixes won't break my code.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer runs `stomper fix` on their codebase
2. Stomper discovers quality issues using existing quality tools (Ruff, MyPy)
3. Stomper converts each error into an AI prompt with context
4. Stomper calls cursor-cli in headless mode to generate fixes
5. Stomper applies fixes and validates them don't break tests
6. Stomper commits changes with conventional commit messages
7. Developer reviews and approves the automated fixes

### Context-Aware Error Resolution

As a developer, I want Stomper to understand the context of my codebase and generate appropriate fixes, so that the automated fixes are relevant, maintainable, and follow my project's coding standards.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Stomper analyzes the error location and surrounding code context
2. Stomper considers project-specific patterns and conventions
3. Stomper generates contextual prompts that include relevant code snippets
4. AI agent generates fixes that are appropriate for the specific context
5. Stomper validates fixes against project patterns and standards

### Intelligent Error Mapping

As a developer, I want Stomper to learn from successful fixes and improve its error resolution strategies, so that it becomes more effective over time and can handle complex error patterns.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Stomper tracks which error types and fix strategies are most successful
2. Stomper builds a mapping of error patterns to effective fix approaches
3. Stomper adapts its prompting strategy based on historical success rates
4. Stomper provides better context and instructions for similar errors in the future

## Spec Scope

1. **Swappable AI Agent Protocol** - Create a base class/protocol for AI agents that allows easy swapping of different AI providers
2. **Cursor CLI Headless Integration** - Integrate with cursor-cli headless mode for AI-powered code generation and fixing
3. **Error-to-Prompt Generation** - Convert quality tool errors into structured AI prompts with code context and fix instructions
4. **File Processing Workflow** - Process files through AI agents with validation and rollback capabilities
5. **Simple Error Mapping System** - Track successful fix patterns and adapt prompting strategies for improved results
6. **Fix Validation System** - Validate AI-generated fixes don't break existing functionality or tests

## Out of Scope

- Advanced learning algorithms (moved to Phase 2)
- Multi-agent coordination (moved to Phase 2)
- Custom AI model training (moved to Phase 2)
- Web dashboard for monitoring (moved to Phase 3)
- Multi-language support beyond Python (moved to Phase 3)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional AI Agent Integration** - Stomper can automatically fix code quality issues using cursor-cli headless mode with 80%+ success rate
2. **Context-Aware Fixing** - AI-generated fixes are contextually appropriate and maintain code quality standards
3. **Robust Validation** - All automated fixes are validated to ensure they don't break existing functionality
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Full test coverage for AI agent integration with mock testing for cursor-cli interactions
