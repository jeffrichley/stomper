## 🔑 Key Findings from Documentation

### 1. LangGraph Is Primary Design (langgraph-workflow.md)

You have a **COMPLETE state machine design** already documented! The workflow includes:

```
Initialize → Collect Errors → Process File → Verify Fixes
              ↓                                    ↓
          Run Tests ← [retry logic] ← [test validation]
              ↓
          Commit Changes → Next File → Cleanup
```

**All nodes, edges, and state structure are specified!** 🎉

### 2. Git Worktree Strategy Is Critical (git_flow.md)

From your conversation with ChatGPT, you have a **clear safety strategy:**

> **"Agent never touches your codebase directly. You control the merge/push."**

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create isolated sandbox
git worktree add /tmp/stomper/sbx_T123 -b sbx/T123 HEAD

# Agent works in sandbox (isolated!)
# Extract diff (app controls it)
# Cleanup worktree + branch
```

**Why it matters:** Even if AI destroys the sandbox, your main code is 100% safe! 🛡️

### 3. Components Are Ready (Tasks 1-5 Complete)

All building blocks exist:
- ✅ **AIAgent protocol** (Task 1)
- ✅ **CursorClient** (Task 2)
- ✅ **PromptGenerator with adaptive strategies** (Task 3)
- ✅ **FixApplier** (Task 4)
- ✅ **ErrorMapper for learning** (Task 5)

**Task 6 = Wire them together in LangGraph! 🔌**

## 📋 Implementation Breakdown

### Task 6.1: Integration Tests (3-4 hours)

Write **comprehensive tests** for:
- Full end-to-end workflow
- Retry and error handling
- Git worktree isolation
- Adaptive learning

**TDD Approach:** Tests first, then implementation

### Task 6.2: LangGraph Orchestrator (4-5 hours)

**THE BIG ONE!** Create:
- `workflow/state.py` - State definitions
- `workflow/orchestrator.py` - LangGraph workflow
- All 10 workflow nodes
- Conditional edges and transitions

**Components integrated:**
- AgentManager
- PromptGenerator  
- FixApplier
- ErrorMapper
- QualityToolManager

### Task 6.3: CLI Integration (2-3 hours)

Add workflow options to `stomper fix`:
```bash
stomper fix \
  --sandbox/--no-sandbox \
  --test/--no-test \
  --max-retries 3 \
  --strategy batch_errors \
  --agent cursor-cli
```

**Rich output** with beautiful tables showing results! ✨

### Task 6.4: Sandbox Manager (3-4 hours)

Implement **git worktree isolation:**
- Create ephemeral sandboxes
- Extract diffs
- Cleanup worktrees + branches
- Test isolation (no damage to main workspace)

### Task 6.5: Error Handling & Logging (2-3 hours)

**Rich logging** with:
- Colored output
- Progress indicators
- Error recovery strategies
- Optional log file

### Task 6.6: Validation (2-3 hours)

**Verify everything works:**
- Run complete test suite
- Manual testing on real project
- End-to-end validation
- Documentation updates

**Total Time:** 16-22 hours (2-3 days of focused work)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes This Special

Your documentation shows you've thought deeply about:

1. **Safety** - Git worktrees protect main codebase
2. **Intelligence** - Adaptive learning improves over time
3. **Validation** - Tests prevent broken fixes
4. **UX** - Rich output makes it delightful to use
5. **Architecture** - LangGraph provides robust orchestration

### This Is More Than Integration

Task 6 isn't just "connecting the pieces" - it's the **orchestration layer** that:
- Manages complex state transitions
- Ensures safety through isolation
- Validates quality through testing
- Enables learning through adaptation
- Provides exceptional UX

**It's the culmination of all Week 2 work! 🎊**
