## 2025-01-15: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Stomper is an automated code quality fixing tool that systematically resolves linting errors, type errors, and test failures using AI agents while maintaining code integrity. The tool targets Python developers who want to eliminate the tedious manual process of fixing code quality issues.

### Context

The current process of fixing code quality issues is manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Developers spend significant time running quality tools, manually fixing issues, running tests, and dealing with broken tests. This creates friction in the development workflow and reduces productivity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Fixing Process**
   - Pros: Full control, no automation complexity
   - Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone, repetitive, breaks workflow

2. **Simple Script Automation**
   - Pros: Basic automation, simple implementation
   - Cons: Limited intelligence, no AI integration, poor error handling

3. **Existing Tools (Black, Ruff --fix)**
   - Pros: Proven, reliable auto-fixes
   - Cons: Limited scope, no intelligent decision making, no test validation

### Rationale

The AI-powered approach provides the best balance of automation and intelligence. By leveraging cursor-cli and LangGraph, we can create a system that not only fixes issues but also validates fixes, handles complex scenarios, and maintains code integrity through comprehensive testing.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduces time spent on code quality fixes by 80%
- Eliminates repetitive manual work
- Improves code quality consistency
- Enables focus on higher-value development tasks
- Provides rollback capabilities for safety

## 2025-01-15: Test Organization and CliRunner Classification

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Testing
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, QA Team

### Decision

Any test that uses `CliRunner` from `typer.testing` should be classified as an end-to-end (e2e) test and placed in the `tests/e2e/` directory, not in `tests/unit/`.

### Context

`CliRunner` tests actually invoke the full CLI application, including argument parsing, file discovery, tool execution, and output formatting. These are integration tests that exercise the entire application stack, not unit tests that test isolated components.

### Rationale

- **Unit tests** should test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **E2E tests** should test the full application workflow
- `CliRunner` tests the complete CLI interface, making them e2e by definition
- This separation improves test performance (unit tests run faster)
- It provides clearer test organization and purpose

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster unit test execution (no CLI invocation overhead)
- Clearer separation of test types
- Better test organization
- More accurate test categorization

**Implementation:**
- Move all `CliRunner` tests from `tests/unit/` to `tests/e2e/`
- Update justfile to exclude e2e tests from unit test runs
- Ensure e2e tests are properly marked with `@pytest.mark.e2e`

## 2025-01-15: Testing Best Practices - Robust Exception Testing

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use robust exception testing patterns that avoid brittle string matching in `pytest.raises`. Prefer exception types over message matching, and use structured error attributes when available.

### Context

Current tests use fragile string matching like `match="greater than or equal to 1"` which breaks when error messages change, even if the underlying validation logic is correct. This creates maintenance overhead and false test failures.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **String Matching (Current)**
   - Pros: Simple to implement
   - Cons: Brittle, breaks on message changes, maintenance overhead

2. **Exception Type Only**
   - Pros: Robust, focuses on correctness
   - Cons: Less specific validation

3. **Structured Error Attributes**
   - Pros: Robust, specific, uses Pydantic's structured error data
   - Cons: Slightly more complex

4. **Custom Exceptions**
   - Pros: Full control, clear structure
   - Cons: Additional complexity for simple cases

### Rationale

The hierarchy of robustness is:
1. Check exception type only (most stable)
2. Inspect structured attributes (`.errors()`, fields)
3. Match regex minimally if no structure exists
4. Define custom exceptions with fields
5. Use snapshot testing if messages matter for UX

This approach ensures tests remain stable while still providing meaningful validation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Tests are more robust and maintainable
- Reduced false test failures from message changes
- Better focus on actual correctness vs. message formatting
- Easier to maintain as Pydantic updates

**Implementation:**
- Replace string matching with exception type checking
- Use Pydantic's structured error data when available
- Apply pattern consistently across all validation tests

**Negative:**
- Adds complexity with AI agent integration
- Requires maintenance of error mapping system
- May need fine-tuning for different codebases
- Initial setup and configuration overhead

## 2025-01-15: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Typer for CLI framework, LangChain + LangGraph for AI agent orchestration, and a hybrid approach for tool execution that supports both custom configurations and automatic package manager detection (UV/Poetry/pip).

### Context

The tool needs to be flexible enough to work with different Python project setups while providing a modern, type-safe CLI interface and sophisticated AI agent coordination.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Click CLI Framework**
   - Pros: Mature, widely used
   - Cons: Less modern, no built-in type hints

2. **Direct AI Agent Integration**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation
   - Cons: No state management, poor error handling, limited workflow control

3. **Fixed Tool Execution**
   - Pros: Simple, predictable
   - Cons: Not flexible, doesn't work with all project setups

### Rationale

Typer provides modern type-safe CLI development, LangGraph offers sophisticated state machine capabilities for complex workflows, and the hybrid tool execution approach ensures maximum compatibility while allowing customization.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, maintainable codebase
- Excellent developer experience with type hints
- Robust workflow orchestration
- Maximum project compatibility
- Extensible architecture

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for LangGraph
- More complex initial implementation
- Additional dependencies to maintain

## 2025-01-15: Error Mapping Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use simple file-based error mapping system with markdown files organized by tool and error code, rather than complex YAML or database systems.

### Context

The tool needs to provide specific advice for different error types to help AI agents make better fixing decisions. This advice system should be maintainable and extensible.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **YAML Configuration System**
   - Pros: Structured, machine-readable
   - Cons: Complex to maintain, can become unwieldy

2. **Database-Driven System**
   - Pros: Dynamic, queryable
   - Cons: Overkill for static advice, adds complexity

3. **Hardcoded Advice**
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Not extensible, difficult to maintain

### Rationale

Simple markdown files provide the right balance of human readability and machine processability. They're easy to edit, version control, and extend without adding unnecessary complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Easy to maintain and edit
- Human-readable format
- Version controllable
- Extensible without code changes
- Simple to implement

**Negative:**
- Less structured than YAML
- Manual file management required
- No built-in validation
