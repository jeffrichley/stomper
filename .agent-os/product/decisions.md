## 2025-01-15: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Stomper is an automated code quality fixing tool that systematically resolves linting errors, type errors, and test failures using AI agents while maintaining code integrity. The tool targets Python developers who want to eliminate the tedious manual process of fixing code quality issues.

### Context

The current process of fixing code quality issues is manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Developers spend significant time running quality tools, manually fixing issues, running tests, and dealing with broken tests. This creates friction in the development workflow and reduces productivity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Fixing Process**
   - Pros: Full control, no automation complexity
   - Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone, repetitive, breaks workflow

2. **Simple Script Automation**
   - Pros: Basic automation, simple implementation
   - Cons: Limited intelligence, no AI integration, poor error handling

3. **Existing Tools (Black, Ruff --fix)**
   - Pros: Proven, reliable auto-fixes
   - Cons: Limited scope, no intelligent decision making, no test validation

### Rationale

The AI-powered approach provides the best balance of automation and intelligence. By leveraging cursor-cli and LangGraph, we can create a system that not only fixes issues but also validates fixes, handles complex scenarios, and maintains code integrity through comprehensive testing.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduces time spent on code quality fixes by 80%
- Eliminates repetitive manual work
- Improves code quality consistency
- Enables focus on higher-value development tasks
- Provides rollback capabilities for safety

**Negative:**
- Adds complexity with AI agent integration
- Requires maintenance of error mapping system
- May need fine-tuning for different codebases
- Initial setup and configuration overhead

## 2025-01-15: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Typer for CLI framework, LangChain + LangGraph for AI agent orchestration, and a hybrid approach for tool execution that supports both custom configurations and automatic package manager detection (UV/Poetry/pip).

### Context

The tool needs to be flexible enough to work with different Python project setups while providing a modern, type-safe CLI interface and sophisticated AI agent coordination.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Click CLI Framework**
   - Pros: Mature, widely used
   - Cons: Less modern, no built-in type hints

2. **Direct AI Agent Integration**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation
   - Cons: No state management, poor error handling, limited workflow control

3. **Fixed Tool Execution**
   - Pros: Simple, predictable
   - Cons: Not flexible, doesn't work with all project setups

### Rationale

Typer provides modern type-safe CLI development, LangGraph offers sophisticated state machine capabilities for complex workflows, and the hybrid tool execution approach ensures maximum compatibility while allowing customization.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, maintainable codebase
- Excellent developer experience with type hints
- Robust workflow orchestration
- Maximum project compatibility
- Extensible architecture

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for LangGraph
- More complex initial implementation
- Additional dependencies to maintain

## 2025-01-15: Error Mapping Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use simple file-based error mapping system with markdown files organized by tool and error code, rather than complex YAML or database systems.

### Context

The tool needs to provide specific advice for different error types to help AI agents make better fixing decisions. This advice system should be maintainable and extensible.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **YAML Configuration System**
   - Pros: Structured, machine-readable
   - Cons: Complex to maintain, can become unwieldy

2. **Database-Driven System**
   - Pros: Dynamic, queryable
   - Cons: Overkill for static advice, adds complexity

3. **Hardcoded Advice**
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Not extensible, difficult to maintain

### Rationale

Simple markdown files provide the right balance of human readability and machine processability. They're easy to edit, version control, and extend without adding unnecessary complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Easy to maintain and edit
- Human-readable format
- Version controllable
- Extensible without code changes
- Simple to implement

**Negative:**
- Less structured than YAML
- Manual file management required
- No built-in validation
