# Send() API State Isolation - How It Works üîí

## Your Questions Answered

### Q1: "Will each branch get a different state dict?"
**YES! ‚úÖ** Each Send() creates a **completely separate state dict**.

### Q2: "Is there any way multiple agents get the same file?"
**NO! ‚ùå** Each file is assigned to **exactly ONE** parallel branch.

### Q3: "Does Send() take care of this for us?"
**YES! ‚úÖ** LangGraph's Send() API **guarantees** state isolation.

## üîç How State Isolation Works

### The Fan-Out Code:
```python
def _fan_out_files(self, state: StomperState):
    files = state.get("files", [])  # e.g., [file_a, file_b, file_c]
    
    return [
        Send("process_single_file", {
            **state,                    # ‚Üê Spread creates NEW dict
            "current_file": file,       # ‚Üê Each dict gets DIFFERENT file
        })
        for file in files
    ]
```

### What Happens Step-by-Step:

**Before Send():**
```python
state = {
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "files": [file_a, file_b, file_c],
    "successful_fixes": [],
    # ... other shared state ...
}
```

**After Send() Fan-Out:**
```python
# LangGraph creates 3 SEPARATE state dicts:

# Branch 1 state:
{
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "files": [file_a, file_b, file_c],  # Full list (for context)
    "current_file": file_a,              # ‚Üê THIS branch processes file_a
    "successful_fixes": [],
}

# Branch 2 state:
{
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "files": [file_a, file_b, file_c],
    "current_file": file_b,              # ‚Üê THIS branch processes file_b
    "successful_fixes": [],
}

# Branch 3 state:
{
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "files": [file_a, file_b, file_c],
    "current_file": file_c,              # ‚Üê THIS branch processes file_c
    "successful_fixes": [],
}
```

**Key Point:** Each branch has:
- ‚úÖ Same base state (session_id, config, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Different `current_file` (the file it's processing)
- ‚úÖ Completely independent execution

## üîí Safety Guarantees

### 1. **No File Gets Processed Twice**
```python
# Fan-out creates ONE Send() per file:
for file in files:  # Loop ensures each file appears exactly once
    Send("process_single_file", {..., "current_file": file})
```

### 2. **Each Branch is Independent**
```python
async def _process_single_file_complete(self, state: dict) -> dict:
    current_file = state["current_file"]  # ‚Üê Each branch sees DIFFERENT file
    
    # Branch 1: current_file = file_a (ONLY)
    # Branch 2: current_file = file_b (ONLY)
    # Branch 3: current_file = file_c (ONLY)
    
    # Process THIS file (and only this file)
    worktree_id = f"{session_id}_{current_file.file_path.stem}"  # Unique ID
```

### 3. **State Merging is Automatic**
Thanks to Annotated reducers, results from ALL branches are merged:

```python
# In state.py:
successful_fixes: Annotated[list[str], add]  # Auto-concatenate

# Branch 1 returns: {"successful_fixes": ["file_a"]}
# Branch 2 returns: {"successful_fixes": ["file_b"]}
# Branch 3 returns: {"successful_fixes": ["file_c"]}

# LangGraph automatically merges to:
# {"successful_fixes": ["file_a", "file_b", "file_c"]}
```

## üéØ Real-World Example

### Scenario: Processing 3 Python files with linting errors

**Input:**
```python
files = [
    FileState(file_path="utils.py", errors=[...]),
    FileState(file_path="models.py", errors=[...]),
    FileState(file_path="views.py", errors=[...]),
]
```

**Fan-Out:**
```python
return [
    Send("process_single_file", {...state, "current_file": utils_file}),
    Send("process_single_file", {...state, "current_file": models_file}),
    Send("process_single_file", {...state, "current_file": views_file}),
]
```

**Parallel Execution:**
```
Branch 1 (utils.py):
  1. Create worktree: /tmp/worktree_abc123_utils
  2. Fix errors in utils.py
  3. Lock ‚Üí Apply diff to main
  4. Commit in main
  5. Destroy worktree
  6. Return: {"successful_fixes": ["utils.py"], "total_errors_fixed": 5}

Branch 2 (models.py):
  1. Create worktree: /tmp/worktree_abc123_models
  2. Fix errors in models.py
  3. Lock ‚Üí Apply diff to main
  4. Commit in main
  5. Destroy worktree
  6. Return: {"successful_fixes": ["models.py"], "total_errors_fixed": 3}

Branch 3 (views.py):
  1. Create worktree: /tmp/worktree_abc123_views
  2. Fix errors in views.py
  3. Lock ‚Üí Apply diff to main
  4. Commit in main
  5. Destroy worktree
  6. Return: {"successful_fixes": ["views.py"], "total_errors_fixed": 7}
```

**Aggregation (automatic via Annotated reducers):**
```python
{
    "successful_fixes": ["utils.py", "models.py", "views.py"],  # Concatenated
    "total_errors_fixed": 15  # 5 + 3 + 7 (summed)
}
```

## üîê Critical Section Protection

### Why We Still Need asyncio.Lock:

Even though state is isolated, **Git operations must be serialized**:

```python
# In _process_single_file_complete:

# ‚úÖ SAFE: Each branch has its own worktree
worktree_path = self.sandbox_manager.create_sandbox(
    session_id=worktree_id,  # Unique per file
    base_branch="HEAD"
)

# ‚ùå UNSAFE without lock: All branches write to SAME main repo
async with self._diff_application_lock:  # ‚Üê CRITICAL!
    main_repo.git.apply(patch_file)      # Race condition without lock
    main_repo.index.commit(commit_msg)   # Race condition without lock
```

**Why Lock is Needed:**
- Each branch has its own worktree ‚úÖ (isolated)
- But all branches apply diffs to the **same main workspace** ‚ùå (shared resource!)
- Without lock: Git conflicts, corruption, race conditions

## üìä Summary

| Aspect | Status | How It Works |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **State Isolation** | ‚úÖ Guaranteed | Each Send() creates new state dict |
| **File Assignment** | ‚úÖ Unique | Each file appears in exactly ONE Send() |
| **Parallel Safety** | ‚úÖ Safe | Each branch has independent state |
| **Result Merging** | ‚úÖ Automatic | Annotated reducers handle it |
| **Git Safety** | ‚úÖ Protected | asyncio.Lock serializes Git ops |

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **Send() API = Automatic State Isolation**
   - You don't have to manage it
   - LangGraph handles it for you
   - Each branch gets its own state copy

2. **No Duplicate Processing**
   - Loop creates ONE Send() per file
   - Each file processed exactly once
   - No race conditions possible

3. **Two Layers of Safety**
   - **State isolation** (LangGraph): Each branch independent
   - **Critical section locks** (asyncio): Git operations serialized

4. **Automatic Aggregation**
   - Annotated reducers merge results
   - No manual merging needed
   - Works perfectly with parallel execution

## ‚úÖ Your Questions - Final Answer

**Q: "Will each branch get a different state dict?"**
‚úÖ **YES!** Each Send() creates a completely separate state dict.

**Q: "Can multiple agents get the same file?"**
‚ùå **NO!** Each file is assigned to exactly ONE Send() object.

**Q: "Does Send() take care of this?"**
‚úÖ **YES!** LangGraph's Send() API guarantees complete state isolation.

**Bonus Fix:**
‚úÖ Removed duplicate `_get_version()` method - only one remains now!
